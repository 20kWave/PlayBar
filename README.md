# Sound Clout Active Player Module

This features an animated player synced proportionally with a time-stamped location in a song. Its clickable components include a play/pause toggle button, fastforward/rewind buttons, shuffle/repeat buttons, hover volume control, album thumbnails, a like button, and a "up next" pop up menu.  The "up next" pop up menu also features a button to clear the list, a toggle to autoplay upcoming tracks, as well as like buttons and a pop-up options menu for each track.  The menu allows you to like, share, add or remove from "next up", add to a playlist, or start a radio station of related tracks.
